      <h3>Arduino Project</h3>
      <details>
      <summary><strong>Part 1:</strong></summary>
      <p>This hands-on project is just a minor part of a big installation. The purpose is to maximize the data accuracy, analyze and find the best way to optimize the functionability of the Arduino Board when it is installed later.<br></p>
      <p><strong>Apparatus Used:</strong> Arduino, Adafruit BMP280 Sensor Pins, Adafruit Ultimate GPS Breakout v.3 Pins, Pulse Generator, Oscilloscope Monitor</p>
      <details>
        <summary><strong>Challenges:</strong></summary>
        <details>
          <summary><strong>Coding Accuracy Optimisation</strong></summary>
          <p>Before I compared how the baud rate and the pulse frequency affected the data accuracy, there was always a problem with the code that decreased the accuracy of the data and significantly increased the memory usage.
            I looked deeper into how the data was being transmitted, reading the arduino manual and the code tutorial to see how can I modified the code to make a better version of the code that could solve the problems.
            After reading all of those, I successfully coded a better version that used less memories and increased the data accuracy</p>
          <p><strong>Reflections:</strong> Since this is my very first experience to apply my theoretical knowledge into a hands-on project (ignoring all labs in class), I know how a real-life project is very different from high school's lab
          I learned to find potential issues such as the memory usage of a code and the functions of each pin in Arduino, combining all of my knowledge to result in a better version of the code.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary><strong>Finding The Patterns and The Abnormality</strong></summary>
          <p>As shown above, when we list out the frequency and the baud rate, we can see a certain pattern about the communication between the Arduino and the computer. Also, there will be some abnormality that I need to figure out the reason.
            I looked deeper into the communication between an Arduino and a computer, and noticed something I can use a code to verify. Therefore I implemented the code below.</p>
          <p><strong>Programming Language:</strong> Arduino IDE (Simplified C++)</p>
          <pre><code>

          </code></pre>
          <p>This code significantly show how data loss increases when the baud rate or the frequency increases. This means that th ehigher the frequency or baud rate, the more unstable the communication.
            This is because the <strong>throughput</strong> of data communication may decrease due to the amount of data transfer over a time. It can be solved by exchanging the cable for communication.
          </p>

      <details>
      <summary><strong>Part 2:</strong></summary>
      <p>This part is to measures the voltage whenever the 2 graph from pulse generator intersect.</p>
        <p><strong>Apparatus Used:</strong> Arduino Board, Pulse Generator, Oscilloscope Monitor</p>
